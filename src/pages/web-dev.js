                            This is a flask web app that procedurally generates a snowflake design using a L-system.
                            <br/><br/>
                            The L-system grammar used in this project consists of the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Axiom (initial configuration)
                                    <ul><li>Default: 'FX'</li></ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Symbols that correspond to rendering/drawing instructions:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>'F', 'X' : go forward</li>
                                        <li>'-' : rotate right</li>
                                        <li>'+' : rotate left</li>
                                        <li>'[' : save current state (position and orientation)</li>
                                        <li>']' : restore previous state (position and orientation)</li>
                                        <li>'&lt;' : halve draw distance</li>
                                        <li>'&gt;' : double draw distance</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Grammar: rules determining what symbols should appear based on different contexts (i.e. given a single symbol (precondition), replace it with a set of symbols (post condition)
                                    <ul><li>'X' â†’ '&lt;F[+FX][-FX]FFFF[+FX][-FX]FXF&gt;'</li></ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <br/>
                            The drawing is created using the turtle module. The turtle's movements are defined by the generated L-system.
